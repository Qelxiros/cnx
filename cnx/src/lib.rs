//! A simple X11 status bar for use with simple WMs.
//!
//! Cnx is written to be customisable, simple and fast. Where possible, it
//! prefers to asynchronously wait for changes in the underlying data sources
//! (and uses [`mio`]/[`tokio`] to achieve this), rather than periodically
//! calling out to external programs.
//!
//! # How to use
//!
//! Cnx is a library that allows you to make your own status bar.
//!
//! In normal usage, you will create a new binary project that relies on the
//! `cnx` crate, and customize it through options passed to the main [`Cnx`]
//! object and its widgets. (It's inspired by [`QTile`] and [`dwm`], in that the
//! configuration is done entirely in code, allowing greater extensibility
//! without needing complex configuration handling).
//!
//! An simple example of a binary using Cnx is:
//!
//! ```no_run
//!
//! use cnx::text::*;
//! use cnx::widgets::*;
//! use cnx::{Cnx, Position};
//! use anyhow::Result;
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<()> {
//!     let attr = Attributes {
//!         font: Font::new("Envy Code R 21"),
//!         fg_color: Color::white(),
//!         bg_color: None,
//!         padding: Padding::new(8.0, 8.0, 0.0, 0.0),
//!     };
//!
//!     let mut cnx = Cnx::new(Position::Top);
//!     cnx.add_widget(ActiveWindowTitle::new(attr.clone()));
//!     cnx.add_widget(Clock::new(attr.clone(), None));
//!     cnx.run()?;
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A more complex example is given in [`src/bin/cnx.rs`] alongside the project.
//! (This is the default `[bin]` target for the crate, so you _could_ use it by
//! either executing `cargo run` from the crate root, or even running `cargo
//! install cnx; cnx`. However, neither of these are recommended as options for
//! customizing Cnx are then limited).
//!
//! Before running Cnx, you'll need to make sure your system has the required
//! dependencies, which are described in the [`README`][readme-deps].
//!
//! # Built-in widgets
//!
//! There are currently these widgets available:
//!
//! - [`crate::widgets::ActiveWindowTitle`] — Shows the title ([`EWMH`]'s `_NET_WM_NAME`) for
//!   the currently focused window ([`EWMH`]'s `_NEW_ACTIVE_WINDOW`).
//! - [`crate::widgets::Pager`] — Shows the WM's workspaces/groups, highlighting whichever is
//!   currently active. (Uses [`EWMH`]'s `_NET_DESKTOP_NAMES`,
//!   `_NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS` and `_NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP`).
//! - [`crate::widgets::Clock`] — Shows the time.
//!
//! The cnx-contrib crate contains additional widgets:
//!
//! - **Sensors** — Periodically parses and displays the output of the
//!   sensors provided by the system.
//! - **Volume** - Shows the current volume/mute status of the default output
//!   device.
//! - **Battery** - Shows the remaining battery and charge status.
//! - **Wireless** - Shows the wireless strength of your current network.
//! - **CPU** - Shows the current CPU consumption
//! - **Weather** - Shows the Weather information of your location
//! - **Disk Usage** - Show the current usage of your monted filesystem
//!
//! The Sensors, Volume and Battery widgets require platform
//! support. They currently support Linux (see dependencies below) and OpenBSD.
//! Support for additional platforms should be possible.
//!
//! # Dependencies
//!
//! In addition to the Rust dependencies in `Cargo.toml`, Cnx also depends on
//! these system libraries:
//!
//!  - `xcb-util`: `xcb-ewmh` / `xcb-icccm` / `xcb-keysyms`
//!  - `x11-xcb`
//!  - `pango`
//!  - `cairo`
//!  - `pangocairo`
//!
//! Some widgets have additional dependencies on Linux:
//!
//!  - **Volume** widget relies on `alsa-lib`
//!  - **Sensors** widget relies on [`lm_sensors`] being installed.
//!  - **Wireless** widget relies on `libiw-dev`.
//!
//! # Creating new widgets
//!
//! Cnx is designed such that thirdparty widgets can be written in external
//! crates and used with the main [`Cnx`] instance. However, I've never done
//! this.
//!
//! The adventurous may choose to implement the [`Widget`] trait and see how
//! far they can get. The [`Widget`] implementation can assume it's being run
//! from a single-threaded [`tokio`] event-loop, but this is an implementation
//! detail that should not be relied upon.
//!
//! The built-in [`widgets`] should give you some examples on which to base
//! your work.
